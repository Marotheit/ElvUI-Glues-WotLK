# ElvUI-Glues-WotLK
Retextures of the login, character selection, and character creation screens for use with ElvUI for Wrath of the Lich King, version 3.3.5a. Available in [BLP](https://github.com/Marotheit/ElvUI-Glues-WotLK/edit/main/ElvUI%20Glues%20for%20WotLK.zip) or [MPQ](https://github.com/Marotheit/ElvUI-Glues-WotLK/edit/main/patch-7.MPQ) format.

Editing the main menu is a challenge, so I wanted to release this for other to build upon. Feel free to submit a pull request if you change anything to look better.

## Installation
### BLP Format:
Unzip the `ElvUI Glues for WotLK.zip`, and place all the folders alongside the AddOns folder inside `World of Warcraft\Interface\`.

### MPQ Format:
Place `patch-7.MPQ` alongside other graphical patches inside `World of Warcraft\Data\`.
